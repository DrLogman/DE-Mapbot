This is a project I worked on with some friends for our Digital Electronics class in Fall 2024.
Our goal was to make a robot that would move around a room and scan nearby objects with ultrasonic sensors. These scans would then translate to a Unity visualization of the room.
We were mostly able to make this a reality, though the robot burns through 9V batteries like crazy.

The Mapbot folder is the Unity project, and the Sketches folder includes all of the sketches used throughout the making of this project. 
We were initially going to use a master/slave system to have two arduinos piloting the robot, but we ended up only needing one.
I never changed the file name, though, so the main sketch is still named SlaveSketch.
